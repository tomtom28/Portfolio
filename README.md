# Portfolio
This is my Personal Portfolio using Bootstrap!

Please checkout my wepbage at [thomas-thompson.herokuapp.com](http://thomas-thompson.herokuapp.com/).

This page chronicles all of the projects that I developed while at Rutgers Coding Bootcamp, NJIT, and beyond.

Please check in periodically since I am constantly adding new projects.

All of the clip art icons in the app can be found [here](http://www.flaticon.com/)!
